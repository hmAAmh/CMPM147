				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>My main goal with this project was to convey a difference in mood between the dungeon version of the map and the overworld version, while still keeping clear commonalities between them. I achieved this through both the consistency of their general shape and layout, as well as reusing the same dirt texture between them.

					The core layout was created using a series of rectangles placed throughout the grid, each with varying sizes. For each rectangle, a random chance was given to connect it via a path to one other rectangle. These rectangles are allowed to overlap with eachother.
					
					Afterwards, a radius was given around this layout for a secondary later. Beyond that, the remaining spaces were filled in with the third layer.
					
					In the dungeon layout, the main floor tiles were filled in through random chance. The dirt on a floor had a chance of rocks to appear in any random location. Additionally, doors had a chance to be placed in the top tial, to appear as though they're adjacent to the walls. Chests were randomly placed near walls of all the other cardinal directions.
					
					In the overworld layout, the dirt had a random chance to have rocks placed on them, similar to the dungeon variant. Additionally, two different types of trees have a random chance of spawning on the grassy planes.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I wrote all of the code in the project. Overall, this assignment felt like a way to explore the creative potential present within the relatively limited framework, and through that I was able to find a large amount of interesting possibilities for expression through generative design. One of the most satisfying aspects of this project was switching between the two alternate versions of various maps, and seeing how, even though I knew exactly how they worked, the results still felt fresh and surprising to me.</p>
