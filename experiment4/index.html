				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Infinity: I used the infinite extent of my world to represent an endlessly sprawling natural world, while providing the user a large amount of space to experiment with the water drawing systems.

					Variation in Space As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see grass tiles of different colors, with tiles places at different heights. Tiles are rendered to appear three-dimensional. There's a smaller chance for trees and rocks to appear, which are remndered in a similar three-dimensional perspective. Trees have several variations of height which can appear Additionally, small details such as pebbles and lily pads are placed on their respective tiles.
					
					Variations in Key Different worlds will have different variations with title color/height, tree placement, tree height, tree variation. rock placement, and lily pad/pebble placement.
					
					Signs of Life Clicking tiles causes tiles nearby the cursor to crumble and fall into water. The passage of time results in trees swaying in the breeze, lily pads slowly moving in water, the color of the water slowly changes, and the water level rises.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	Overall, I found the experiment interesting to work on for the widely different experiences I had for each project. Despite the common theme and limitations, it was interesting to see how differently each turned out, and it makes me wonder how many similar small projects I could create. While understanding the codebase was initially somewhat difficult, afterwards I found it relatively easy to understand and manipulate the underlying systems, and I tried to push the parts I found most interesting as far as I could. </p>
